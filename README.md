# Real Time Background Blurring using DeeplabV3
This repository contains the code for real time background blurring using deep learning model *[DeeplabV3](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.05587)*. We used the [Keras implementation of DeeplabV3](https://github.com/bonlime/keras-deeplab-v3-plus) with pretrained weights. 

## Introduction
Few days ago Microsoft introduced Teams with a background blur feature for video calls using AI, so I used AI to build my own


Here's a clip with slightly more blur


You can read the blog post about it [here](http://amanullahtariq.com/blog_posts/realtime_bg_blur.html) 



This is the code to detect the parking space for the car given 2D image from the google maps and 3D point Cloud data of the current enivornment.

## DeepLabV3
 DeeplabV3 is a state-of-the-art model for Semantic Segmentation develop by Google Inc. 


## Results
* Initial data 2D image taking from the google image and plotting the lines using OpenCV


* Applying filters to enhance the lines of the parking spots

For this project to run you need:
* Python 3+
* OpenCV
* imutils
* Keras


### Who do I talk to? ###
I would be happy to talk to you about this project and if you are interested then we can further enhance this project to.
